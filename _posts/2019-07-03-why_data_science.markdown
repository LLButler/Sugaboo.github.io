My background in microbiology, infectious disease research and public health really aligned well with Data Science.  For most of my academic and professional career, I’ve always been interested in working with data because it can tell us so much about what we’re trying to understand.  But while I was interested in working with data, I really didn’t know how I could break into the Data Science field.  After all, it took me about a decade of going to college and working to grasp concepts of my field.  The thought of learning a new field was daunting.  I wondered if I had the talent, skills, and ability to learn something new.  Data science was a sexy concept, but I wasn’t sure how I could break into the field.  

From my initial exploration, it took me a few years to take the plunge and get into Data Science.  What really helped with my learning and understanding was going to Data Science workgroups when I worked at the CDC and Meetup.com Data Science groups.  The exposure of Data Science at the CDC was amazing!  They focused more on using and learning R, but overall it was thrilling to see how other Data Scientist were using R to analyze their data.  I also learned quite a bit from people I met at Meetup.com groups and general Data Science interest groups in my area.  I always figured that Data Scientist needed a masters or doctoral degree to get into the field.  But what amazed me was this was hardly the case.  Yes, there were a few who had advanced degrees, but overall it was not needed.  Many I spoke to said that my background and the fact that I did have a masters degree was a plus to become a Data Scientist.  But my level of determination and interests in the field was the prerequisite I needed.  

After getting this initial exposure, I decided to take the plunge and started looking at programs.  I was surprised at how many different Data Science programs there were.  I came across Flatiron’s program and it was the best fit for my needs.  Now that I’m in the program, and I’m learning more than I ever dreamed of!  I’m so thrilled and excited to be in this exciting time of learning the sexiest field of our century.  I just hope I come out of the program an excellent Data Scientist and I’m sure with Flatiron’s support, I will be!
